                      <p>Every module of an application is functionally tested to ensure whether the app is performing the way it was meant to be, the risks will become almost negligible soon after launching.</p>

                      <h3>User Acceptance Testing ( UAT )</h3>
                      <p>UAT simply implies exposing the application under test to real users who will run it on real scenarios that could represent actual realities. This implies you get an enhanced output; in that you update your application; hence you shall obtain results that do favor your expectations as you end by releasing it.</p>
